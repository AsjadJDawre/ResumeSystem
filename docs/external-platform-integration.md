## Overview

The External Platform Integration System simulates how our Resume Builder backend would automatically pull, normalize, and merge data from various external learning and achievement platforms into a unified resume schema. This system demonstrates the architecture for real-time resume updates based on external platform activities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **UnifiedIntegrationEngine** - Main orchestrator class
2. **Mock Data Sources** - Simulated external platform data
3. **Data Normalization** - Converts platform-specific data to unified format
4. **Resume Merging** - Updates resume sections with new data
5. **Future API Adapters** - Stubs for real API integrations

### File Structure

    C --> D[Resume Schema Mapping]
    D --> E[Duplicate Detection]
    E --> F[Resume Update]
    F --> G[Integration Logging]
```

## Integration Process

### 1. Data Fetching
- Parallel API calls to all connected platforms
- Simulated delays to mimic real API responses
- Error handling for failed requests

### 2. Data Normalization
- Platform-specific data converted to unified format
- Skill extraction and categorization
- Date standardization and validation

### 3. Resume Schema Mapping
- **Skills**: Extracted from all platforms, deduplicated
- **Experience**: Internships mapped to experience section
- **Achievements**: Courses, hackathons, verifications as achievements
- **Projects**: Hackathon projects and verified projects

### 4. Duplicate Prevention
- Skills deduplication using case-insensitive matching
- Project uniqueness based on title and description
- Achievement verification to prevent duplicates

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

```javascript
import { simulateIntegration } from './models/integrationSimulation.js';

// Run simulation for a user
const results = await simulateIntegration('user_12345');
console.log(results);
```

### Test Scripts

**Main Test Script (Comprehensive):**
```bash
node test-integration-simulation.js
```

**Debug Test (Troubleshooting):**
```bash
node debug-test.js
```

**Simple Test (Basic Verification):**
```bash
node simple-test.js
```

## Sample Output

The simulation produces a comprehensive report showing:

- **Statistics**: Total skills, experiences, achievements, projects
- **Update Log**: Detailed list of all changes made
- **Skills Breakdown**: Categorized by technology type
- **Experience Summary**: All professional experiences
- **Achievement Analysis**: Grouped by achievement type
- **Project Portfolio**: Organized by project type

### Test Script Descriptions

- **test-integration-simulation.js**: Full-featured test with detailed analysis, skills categorization, and comprehensive reporting
- **debug-test.js**: Debug-focused test for troubleshooting integration issues with error handling and stack traces
- **simple-test.js**: Minimal test for quick verification of basic functionality and import success

## Future API Integration

The system includes adapter stubs for real API integrations:

```javascript
// Future real API adapters
export const InternshalaAPIAdapter = {
  async fetchUserInternships(userId, apiKey) {
    // Real API implementation
  }
};

export const DevpostAPIAdapter = {
  async fetchUserHackathons(userId, apiKey) {
    // Real API implementation
  }
};
```
